# NoLLM Chat

The project aims to revolutionize AI interaction by creating a platform that enhances traditional LLM experiences. It strives to simplify the exploration of AI technologies directly within web browsers, providing a versatile and visual interface. The objective is to enable users to interact with language models in a manner that boosts creativity and enriches their experience, going beyond basic chat interactions.

## Vision

* **Enhanced AI Interaction**: Move beyond traditional LLM chat with a platform offering a more flexible and visual interface. Users can directly edit and guide AI to improve response quality, enabling richer interaction experiences.

* **Automated Personal Workflows**: Empowers users to create custom AI workflows tailored to their needs, enhancing productivity and personalization.

* **Comprehensive AI Learning**: Utilize node-based tools that facilitate interaction with and learning about AI technologies. The platform supports LLMs, prompt engineering, function calls, and vector databases, allowing users to experiment and see the impact of different AI components.

* **Free and Browser-Based**: Operates locally and free of charge, with the option to extend capabilities using services like OpenAI. This ensures accessibility and ease of use directly from the browser.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of the application is designed to efficiently handle different tasks by dividing them into separate threads. This ensures smooth operation and responsiveness of the UI while managing complex processes in the background.

* Main Thread: Handles the UI application logic, ensuring a responsive user interface.
* Database Worker Thread: Manages database operations using TypeORM and PgLite. This thread is responsible for data storage and retrieval without blocking the main UI thread.
* LLM Thread: Dedicated to handling large language model processes using WebLLM and Langchain. This thread manages AI computations and interactions.
* Embedding Thread: Focuses on handling the vector database and embedding models. It processes and manages embeddings for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
